# Type-based Control Flow Integrity

This is a Type-based Control Flow Integrity enforcement implementation build on top of LLVM compiler infrastructure.

We use the skeleton of [llvm-tutor](https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor).

This enforcement should protect you from corrupted code pointers. However, it actually is a coarse-grain implementation because of its `Na√Øve` type analysis.

Currently, there are two phases:

1. __Type Analysis for ICalls__. We currently use `FLTA`, which means First Layer Type Analysis, to analyze the type of icalls, and resolve the candidate targets set.
2. __Instrumentation for Runtime Check__. Before every icalls, we insert checks to determine the target is in the candidate sets.

## Features

- [x] FLTA
- [ ] MLTA
- [ ] Shadow Stack
- [ ] Protection of Metadata
- [x] Runtime Check

## Usage

* Modify `LT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` in `CMakeList.txt` to your llvm directory
* Modify `run.sh`, choose your bitcode file

LLVM bicode file which we use is generated by [wllvm](https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm).
